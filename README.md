# Legal Network Analysis Workshop Series
Periodically, workshops will be organized where speakers and discussants will focus on selected topics, ranging from the purposes of LNA to community detection to centrality measures. The workshops are held online, although some might be organized in person or hybrid. They are, depending on the topic, intended for those who are interested in getting an introduction to LNA as well as for those who have experience in applying LNA. Joining is free of charge.
